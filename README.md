Hello and thanks for trying out the program!

This version is similar to the cloud version but runs much slower, likely because parallel processing of the abstracts organization has not been implemented on any of the versions across the project. It is meant if anyone has a use case of where they need a local program or GUI and need to store the file locally. 

There are two versions, which should not be moved from the original folder structure in order to work. The GUI file is a GUI and is the slowest. However, if you put your email in the email.txt file in the plant_search_text_files folder, the program retreives your email from there so you do not have to re-enter it. The other v0.1 exe file is similar to a command line program and is still slow, but serves the same purpose of local storage.

Thanks!
